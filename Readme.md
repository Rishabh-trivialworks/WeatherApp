This App having get weather of current location with the help of OpenWeatherMap in a regular interval of 2 hours.and also store the api data to shared preference
so that it will not do api hit every time.

For network operation we used Retrofit

For getting current location using fusedlocation api

Event Bus for the communication between components
              decouples event senders and receivers
              performs well with UI artifacts (e.g. Activities, Fragments) and background threads.
